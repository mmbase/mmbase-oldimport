This is the contributions cvs of the MMBase Opensource project
--------------------------------------------------------------

It contains projects created by one or more of the MMBase users that
they would like to share among themselfs, other developers or users.
Each contribution has its own directory based on its name and has to include
a README.txt explaining what it is, who maintains it and how it should be used.
Unlike projects in the applications cvs these are not maintained by the MMBase
commitors as a whole and if you use these you can only fallback to the commitor(s)
outlined. 

To get a name/space in this cvs you need to ask for a vote on the MMBase developers
list. The other commitors will use the following checklist to come to a possitive vote :

- Is there a description of the project that gives you a good idea what the end result will be.

- Is there a maintainer (with commitor state) and a core committor supporting the project

- Is it MMBase related 

- Does it have the MPL license (this is not a place to get free cvs space for commercial projects)

- Does it have value to others in the community. This can be as a total product or as a source
  to copy/modify/steal code (this is opensource afterall)

Once you pass the vote you can start using the space, but other commitors can ask for a vote to 
remove it at some stage in the future if the outlined rules are not followed or if there is no 
effort to keep the contribution valid with newer releases of MMBase.

A good contribution does its best to follow the MMBase build system and work on the head cvs of
mmbase or atleast the last released version. If possible it should also follow the normal install
methods (See PACKAGE-README.txt) or provide clear instructions in english in its README.txt how
to use it. Unlike in applications these are not demands but we prefer it so others have some idea
how to use or understand your contribution.

A more formal reading of these rules is explained in : http://www.mmbase.org/mmdocs/3rdparty.html

Thank you for sharing your work,

The MMBase Community.
