       This file is empty, but it is tree-included so you can override it for yourself.
       I think this should be considered a temporary hack, because it is very limited:
       - you have no influence on the position on which you want to add a menu-item.
       - it is ugly, because you have to add/edit jsps, just to get a new menu-entry.
