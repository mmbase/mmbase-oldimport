      The modules used to load MMBase and optional MMBase functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classes in this package consist of a number of base classes that define the module structure.
      Module and ProcessorModule define basic module functionality, while ModuleProbe can be used to
      trigger periodic maintenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining classes are specific implementations of the Module.
      These modules can be used to add fucntionality to MMBase.
      This includes support modules for the scripting language SCAN, and modules for caching,
      email, communication, statistics, polls, user and session maintenance and transactions ('TCP').
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that a number of essential modules, in particular MMBase, MMAdmin and JDBC, are located in
        their own packages.
