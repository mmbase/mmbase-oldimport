  <!-- <properties>
  You can define properties to be used by the classfile.
  The properties described here are mandatory.
  -->
  <properties>

  <!--
  name="machinename" defines the name that is used in the mmbase cluster,
  it is used for the mmservers objects. Make sure that this is different
  for each node in your cluster. This is not the machines dns name
  (as defined by host as name or ip number).

  You can add the string ${HOST} to include the name of the host
  running the application server (obtained using
  InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName() ).

  You can add the string ${USER} to include the name of the user
  running the application server (obtained using
  System.getProperty("user.name") ).

  This can be useful if you share a web-app over various servers
  (useful for loadbalancing). If you run these servers with different
  user names, you can then use the same configuration for both, and
  still have unique machine names, which you will need to have
  MMBase's clustering system to work properly.

  If you do not specify a machine name, the system falls back to the
  name of the host running the application server, combined with the
  'context' path. This will suffice in most, if not any, cases, so the
  advice is to not add this setting if you don't know excactly what
  you are doing.

  Note that you can also specify this property name as a system
  property by specifying it on the java commandline, using:
  -Dmmbaseroot.mmbasename=myname
  -->
  <!--
  <property name="machinename">MMBaseserver</property>
  -->

  <!--
  name="storagemanagerfactory" defines what factory to use for accessing the storage devices.
  Currently. only DatabaseStorageManagerFactory is implemented, which gives access to various database devices using JDBC.
  -->
  <property name="storagemanagerfactory">org.mmbase.storage.implementation.database.DatabaseStorageManagerFactory</property>

  <!--
  name="datasource-context" defines the jndi context.
  name="datasource" defines the jndi name of the datasource is bounded to
  The Database connections will be retrieved from the application server, so the application-server
  should define a resource for this.
  -->
  <!-- property name="datasource-context">java:comp/env</property -->
  <!-- property name="datasource">jdbc/MMBase</property -->

  <!--
  name="database" defines which database we are using.

  Normally it suffices to change jdbc.xml, and leave this option absent, because a logical default can be deducted
  by the driver setting.

  You may want to specify this option explicitely though if you want something extraordinary, like:

  mysql-latin1 (in stead of default 'mysql'):

       Older mysqls did not support unicode. This misuses latin-1 to store utf-8 any way.

  postgresql_with_views (in stead of default 'postgresql'):

       Postgresql does natively support inheritance. The implemenation is not very sound though,
       because it is based on unions. This is bad for performance, and foreign keys and unique keys
       don't work well any more then.

       Because of that, we can also simulate inheritance using views.

 informix_without_fetchrel_function:

       ...

  mysql (default by driver):

       MySQL support. Inheritance is simulated by duplication.

  postgresql (default by driver):

       PostgreSql support. Inheritance is native.

  hsqldb (default by driver):

      HsqlDB support.  Inheritance is simulated by duplication.

  hypersonic:

     Hypersonic is a predecessor of hsqldb.

  informix (default by driver):

      Informix support: Inheritance is native.

  mmsql (default by driver):

      Microsoft SQL support: Inheritance is simulated by views.

  oracle (default by driver):

      Oracle support: Inheritance is simulated by views.

  <!--
      For some taks, an actual directory for storing data filed is required. Such a directory
      can be configured here.

      It can and will be used as a (base for a) default value for the 'blobs disk' directory,
      for oscache's 'cache.path', for lucene indexes, etc.

  <!--
  name="clustering" the MMBaseChangeInterface which communicates with
  other MMBase instance which use the same storage
  See applications/clustering for implementations
  -->

  <!--
  name="host" the host or ip number of the machine this mmbase node is
  running on. Its important that this name is set correctly because its
  used for communication between mmbase nodes and external devices
  (xml or jini based).

  Default it is : java.net.InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName(), which may very well be correct.
  -->
  <!--
  <property name="host">127.0.0.1</property>

  <!--
  name="basename" You can have multiple mmbase systems inside your database
  if you want this can be very handy when testing of for running multiple
  setups inside one database its added as a preset to all your table names
  like : BASENAME=test will result in table names like test_object and
  test_urls.
  -->
  <property name="basename">mm</property>

  <!--
  name="language" defines a default language for GUI functionality. Effectively this makes it
  possible to override the JVM's default Locale.

  -->
  <property name="language">en</property>

  <!--
  name="encoding"

  The encoding to be used in the database (if the database layer
  needs to know), and for use as default for the pages.  Recommended
  is 'UTF-8', since this can be used for virtually every language on
  the world, and is a superset of ASCII.

  Default though, it is ISO-8859-1, to ensure backwards
  compatibility. Perhaps this will change to UTF-8 once this is
  tested well.
  -->
  <!-- since, when not mentioned it will be ISO-8859-1, all new systems will get utf-8 -->
  <property name="encoding">UTF-8</property>

  <!--
  name="timezone"

  The TimeZone in which this MMBase works. This has influence on what front end users see as the
  'current time'. It is also the working time zone for many other mmbase code. For example also date
  parsing is done relative to this time zone (so 'noon' is 12:00h for this time zone).

  This serves as a default timezone if one needs to override the one from the JVM.  Defaults (if
  empty) to the default JVM's time zone (which is default the Server's time zone).

  E.g.: Europe/Amsterdam, America/New_York, Asia/Chongqing.
  See: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html#getAvailableIDs()

  Will fall back to GMT if not understood (will _not_ fall back to server default)
  -->
  <property name="timezone"></property>


  <!--
  MMBase in 'development mode' is more strict. Most noticably this has an influence on
  whether you can request the value of non-existing fields without an exception.

  Will fall back to 'false' if the property is missing altogether. The behaviour is more like
  in MMBase < 1.8 then.
  -->
  <property name="development">true</property>

  <!--
  name="xmlbuilderwriterdir"
  If specified, MMBase will write xml configuration files  to this directory when loading builders.
  This can be useful if you want to convert old format builder xmls to the new format.

  -->
  <!-- property name="xmlbuilderwriterdir">/home/guest/schooltv/tmpbul/</property -->


  <!--
      If you are sure that your builder XML correspond with your tables, you can set this property to false
      and reduce start up time.
      The property can also be consulted (MMBase#runStartupChecks) by other code, which would perform similar functionality.
  -->
  <property name="runStartupChecks">true</property>
