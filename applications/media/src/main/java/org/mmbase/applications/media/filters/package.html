    <p>
      URL-filters for the MMBase media project. To determin the 'best'
      URL, first a list of all URL's is created and then this list is
      filtered by 'MainFilter' which is normally a combination of some
      other filters. Which other filters those are can be configured with the
      filters.xml.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filtering of those list envolves moving 'good' urls to the top
      of the list, and removing urls which are no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some filters only move good urls to the top, and are implemented
      as java.util.Comparator's. Those filters extend
      the abstract Filter implementation Sorter, and are recognizable because their name ends
      in 'Sorter'.
